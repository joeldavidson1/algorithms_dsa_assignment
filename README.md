# Algorithms & Data Structures Assignment

This interactive program reads in .txt files that contain integers only. It adds the integers into appropiate data structures and sorts them using
different types of sorting algorithms - insertion sort, quick sort, merge sort, and heap sort. In order to search for a number of the user's choice it uses
binary search and interpolation search. 

Steps are displayed to the user in order to show how many steps it takes to either sort or search for different algorithms.
